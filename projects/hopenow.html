  <h2>UI & UX Design</h2>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p class="description"><a href="http://www.hopenow.com/">HopeNow</a> is an organization comprised of lending industry servicers, housing advocates, and the government. Their mission is to assist homeowners and communities with navigating and repairing the mortgage market. They wanted to create a mobile application that would aid people in correctly filling out Freddie Mac Form 710, also known as the Uniform Borrower Assistance Form. I worked with a team of developers and project managers at <a href="https://www.theportal.io">The Portal</a> to build a simplified digital version of the form. This application will be available on the Google Play Store and the iTunes store during late Fall 2017.</p>

    </figure>
  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>I inherited this project from a previous designer and needed to parse both the existing and new requirements. To prevent surprising the client with an entirely new design, I adapted elements from the previous design into my redesign, such as the profile section, the menu drawer, and the progress bar at the top of the application form. This overview is what I sent to the developers for the beginning of the second iteration of the product.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>After creating initial wireframes, I needed to find a color palette for the final design. Using the blue and gold colors in HopeNow's logo as inspiration, I found various shades of blue that paired well with their gold color. Their logo's blue was too bright and saturated to be a digital screen's main color, so I used a milder blue. The gold became an accent color. I also tested my design to see if these colors are friendly toward the whole spectrum of colorblindness, and I am proud to say that it passed the tests.</p>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>Arial is a basic yet readable font and available on most operating systems. Since this application was meant to be used as a utility, I prioritized functionality and ease of use over unique typography and fancy interactions.</p>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p> Disabled buttons and validation errors were meant to be simple and obvious. Various action buttons are clearly labeled and delineated by different colors. "Yes" and "No" radio buttons allowed the user to quickly view and make a selection.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>When a user opens the application, they will first see the "Login" screen (on left). There is also a "Sign Up" tab for users who do not have an account yet (on right). "ACTION" buttons, such as "LOGIN" and "SIGN UP", are disabled until all text boxes have been filled out. For logging in, if the user fills out an incorrectly formatted email address or enters an email address that does not currently have an account, an error message will show and inform the user of their mistake.</p>

    </figure>
  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>After a user has logged in, the application will show "Application" first. If the user is logging in via the account sign up, then the application will show the user's "Profile" first so that the user can fill in their personal information instead. This information will be used to automatically populate certain parts of the digital form. After the user has created and submitted an application, their finished form will be saved and shown in "Submissions", which shows the most recent submission at the top.</p>

      <figcaption class="full-img">Application Overview</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>As the user completes parts of the digital form, green check marks will show alongside the section name (on left) in the overview of the form. Otherwise, a red "x" will appear instead. The application has navigation buttons at the top and bottom of the screen (on right) so that users can easily scroll and click through the form.</p>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>During this project, I learned how important communication is when working in a team. Sometimes, the development team and I had different ideas for how screen interactions should occur, so I needed to clarify and document exactly how each element on the screen interacted with each other and subsequent screens. </p>
