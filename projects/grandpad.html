  <!-- Description: What is grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup>? -->
  <p><a href="https://www.grandpad.net">grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup></a> is a tablet loaded with a custom operating system that contains a collection of basic applications designed for senior users, aged 75 and up. It bridges the isolating digital divide between seniors and their loved ones by pairing with companion Android and iOS applications that friends and family can use to interact with grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup>. Senior users have specific needs that have been long neglected by modern design trends, causing frustration and even fear of interacting with technology. They require explicit user interactions, clear instructions, and simple interfaces. The grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup> tablet is designed to meet these needs so that users are not required to learn extraneous, complicated processes.</p>

  <!-- Description: Informatics Senior Design Project -->
  <p>grandPad, Inc. was a sponsor for my <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/involved/project_class">Informatics Senior Design Project</a>, which was a three-quarter course for senior Informatics and Software Engineering majors at the University of California, Irvine. I worked in a team of 6 people to research and implement a total of 13 software applications for the grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup> tablet. We followed the Agile Scrum methodology to produce, test, and update each iteration of our applications, while releasing approximately 3 applications every quarter. My team actually worked with grandPad, Inc. for more than three-quarters and extended our time together to a total of 1 year. Our goals were to not only meet the established expectations for our course assignments, but to also create a working suite of products for grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup>.</p>

  <!-- Description: Design Proces -->
  <p>I worked with a partner to build 5 of the applications. Together, we conducted user research, pair programmed the application logic, and wrote documentation regarding the project requirements and timelines. My main responsibility was to design the user interfaces. I built various mock-ups and prototypes for our user tests using Adobe PhotoShop, Marvelâ€™s Prototyping on Paper (POP) app, and Microsoft PowerPoint. I also defined the layouts of each application with XML. Additionally, I found sound and graphic assets, which became a surprise hit with the users after the public launch of grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup>. I enjoyed participating in this project because I am interested in building technology for niche populations that are frequently forgotten when it comes to application development. Receiving positive feedback and seeing high usage of my team's applications were greatly rewarding and proved that increasing access to technology should be a priority.</p>

  <!-- Description: Conclusion -->
  <p>Currently, the applications developed by my team have been fully integrated into grandPad<sup>&#174;</sup> and are being used by real customers. Due to a non-disclosure agreement, I cannot provide more public information about the applications, but I would be happy to discuss them if contacted via my <a href="../contact.html">contact form</a>.</p>
