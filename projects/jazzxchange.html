  <h2>UI Design</h2>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p class="description"><a href="www.jazzxchange.org">jazzXchange</a> is an organization that promotes jazz performance and uses its principles to empower communities to celebrate innovation. They originally had a custom built website, which was difficult to update and manage content. I worked with a developer at <a href="www.theportal.io">The Portal</a> to migrate jazzXchange's previous website to WordPress as well as redesigning their entire site. The new site uses the Enfold theme and contains many new features, including a blog.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>jazzXchange wanted to update their website to look more modern and photo-centric. The original home page (on left) was too text heavy and functioned more like an "About" page. For the redesigned home page (center), I selected a photo slideshow and some quick access information in the footer, so that site visitors can immediately view what jazzXchange does, how they do it, and why they do it. All the text was moved to a standalone "About" page (on right).</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>Information about their associates, board members, and advisors also fell under the "About" category, so I created separate pages (on right) for each type of personnel and linked them to the "About" submenu. The original site (on left) had included both board members and advisors on the same page which gave the page a text-heavy feel. For the new design, I resized all the headshot photos and placed them on the right hand side. This was a conscious design decision that also applied to the rest of the site layouts. Due to design limitations within the Enfold theme, this decision resulted in the cleanest, most consistent layout.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>jazzXchanged wanted an more accessible method for informing the public about upcoming events. The previous site had a messy layout and was difficult for non-technical members to add updates and information (on left). With the new site, members can simply update the organization's Google Calendar (center). For any major events, there are separate "Upcoming Events" (on right) and "Feature Events" pages where further details and news can be listed. </p>

    <img class="flex-three-item" src="../images/jazzXchange/new_blog.png" />
  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>There was a lot of new media that jazzXchange wanted to add to their site. For their existing videos, I rearranged them (center) and formed a cohesive, eye-pleasing layout. This prevented the need to constantly scroll through the page like the old website (on left). For the new, additional pictures and videos, I created a "Blog" page (on right) which was also a feature requested by them and allowed them to categorize their media too. </p>

    <img class="flex-two-item" src="../images/jazzXchange/new_contact.png" />
  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>On the previous site, it took many steps for a visitor to contact the organization (on left). They needed to open an email client and write a message to the right person. jazzXchange wanted a more streamlined approach and to add information about volunteering. Each of these reasons for contacting the organization was related to connecting with them and their mission, so I placed the "Contact", "Volunteer", and "Donate" pages under a menu header called "Connect". For the "Contact" page (on right), I used an actual contact form and included preset subject headlines so that the organization members can effortlessly filter their emails.</p>
